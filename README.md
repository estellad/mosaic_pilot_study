# MOSAIC Pilot Study

This repository hosts the code to reproduce the analysis steps for all technologies across all indications, including the visualization code for creating Figure and Supplementary Figures in our manuscript, titled 

<b> Transcriptome Analysis of Archived Tumor Tissues by Visium, GeoMx DSP, and Chromium Methods Reveals Inter- and Intra-Patient Heterogeneity.</b> 

# Installation
To start with replicating our result, clone the repository to your working directory.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bdsc-tds/mosaic_pilot_study.git
```

# Singularity container
The computational environment can be recreated by installing the singularity container from the .def file. The R version we use for this workflow is 4.3.2, and renv is used to track specific versions of packages. Please find files related to renv in reproducibility/r/metadata, and use r.def in reproducibility/r to build the corresponding container:

``` bash
# Note: the current working directory is the root of this repo
cd reproducibility/r
singularity build --fakeroot --force /path/to/the/built/container r.def
```

Launch the container from your terminal.

``` bash
singularity shell --bind /scratch,/users,/work /path/to/container/environment.sif
```

# Analysis
The folder structure of this repository is detailed as follow
```
    CHUV
        ├── Chromium
        ├── Visium
        ├── GeoMx
        └── Manuscript_Figure
            ├── Figure 1 - 6
            └── SuppFig
```

The analysis for each technology should be run in sequential order based on the naming of files. For bash files, only scripts titled main_.sh should be submitted as jobs to high computing clusters. Note that path to container should be modified in _.sh files. 

For visualization, the following code links are mapped to the creation of each figure/supplement figure.
